# Phoenix Project AI Instructions

## Architecture Overview
This project implements a "Remote Bridge" system using a GitHub repository as an asynchronous message queue between a controller and a remote execution environment.

- **Controller (`app.py`)**: A Python Gradio interface that triggers actions by committing a signal file (`remote_trigger.txt`) to the GitHub repository.
- **Worker (`phoenix_listener.sh`)**: A Bash script designed to run on a remote server (specifically Termux/Linux at `/root/project_folder`). It polls the repository for signal files, executes commands, generates status reports (`index.html`), and commits results back.
- **Dashboard (`index.html`)**: A Tailwind CSS-based status page generated by the worker to display system state.

## Core Workflows

### Running the Controller
- **File**: `app.py`
- **Dependencies**: Requires `gradio` and `requests`. 
  - *Note*: If `requirements.txt` only lists `groq`, you must manually ensure `gradio` and `requests` are installed.
- **Configuration**: Requires environment variable `Phoenix_Remote_Trigger` containing a GitHub Personal Access Token with repo scope.
- **Action**: Clicking "START REMOTE BUILD" writes `remote_trigger.txt` to the remote repository.

### Running the Listener
- **File**: `phoenix_listener.sh`
- **Environment**: Intended for a specific remote environment (e.g., Termux on Android).
- **Loop**: 
  1. Pulls from `origin main`.
  2. Checks for existence of `remote_trigger.txt`.
  3. If found: Generates `index.html`, commits changes, removes trigger, and pushes.
  4. Sleeps for 10 seconds.

## Project Conventions

### Communication Pattern
- **Signal**: The presence of `remote_trigger.txt` indicates a pending job.
- **Payload**: The content of the trigger file is base64 encoded.
- **State**: The GitHub repository history serves as the audit log and state store.

### Frontend Style
- **Aesthetic**: "Cyberpunk" / "Nexus Prime" theme.
- **Tech**: Tailwind CSS via CDN.
- **Theme**: Dark mode (`bg-black`, `text-emerald-500`).

### Code Style
- **Python**: Simple script structure, `gradio.Blocks` for UI.
- **Bash**: Verbose status echoing (`echo '🦅 Phoenix Listener...'`). Hardcoded paths (`/root/project_folder`).

## Critical Files
- `app.py`: Main logic for sending signals.
- `phoenix_listener.sh`: logic for receiving and processing signals.
- `public_site/index.html`: The deployed public site (if distinct from root `index.html`).
